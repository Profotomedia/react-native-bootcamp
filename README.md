# React Native Bootcamp - Day 2

## Styling

### Flexbox

React Native uses Flexbox by default.

By default, all View components inherit FlexBox layout out of the box. This is different than the web, where we had to specify `display: flex` in order to implement it.

Another difference between React Native & web in this regard is that React Native had a default `flexDirection` of `column`, whereas the default `flexDirection` of web flexbox implementation is `row`.

This brings us the the next question, if you're not already familiar with flexBox: What doe `flexDirection` do?

#### Flexbox has many properties, but the main ones you will be using for layout are these:

`flexDirection` - Defines the primary axis. Options are `row` or `column`. Default is `column`.    
`justifyContent` - Defines the layout of the primary axis. Options are `flex-start`, `center`, `flex-end`, `space-around` & `space-between`. Default is `flex-start`.   
`alignItems` - Defines the layout of the secondary axis. Options are `flex-start`, `center`, `flex-end`, & `stretch`. Default is `stretch`.
